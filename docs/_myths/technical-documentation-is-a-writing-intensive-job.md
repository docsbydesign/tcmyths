Technical writers must write alot.

## Background

While technical writers write a lot, they also perform many other tasks.

Amity ([Mythbusters: Technical Communication Edition]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/mythbusters-technical-communication-edition)) describes how that was her expectation before working as a tech writer but observed, "most technical communicators are lucky if they can spend even half of their time writing."

Johnson ([14 Widespread Myths about Technical Writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/14-widespread-myths-about-technical-writing)), on the other hand, claims "Most tech writers spend about 10% of their time writing." He then provides a long list of other tasks that a technical writer also performs.

Anuradha ([14 Technical Writing Misconceptions That You Should Know!]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/14-technical-writing-misconceptions-that-you-should-know)) claims that "technical writing teams spend only a
small minority of their time actually writing" because "most technical writers spend a majority of their time understanding the product under study." Her point suggests that technical writers must have strong domain knowledge.

## Survival tips

* Know what you like to do and find the job that fits that best. If you like writing, there are writing-intensive positions that require a lot of writing. On the other hand, if you like tinkering with tech, there are more tinkering-intensive jobs out there, too. 

## Commentary

Technical writing covers a broad spectrum of jobs and responsibilities. Large companies tend to have more specialized technical-writing roles than smaller organizations, but it varies from case to case.
