Writing is writing.

## Background

Blake ([5 Writing Myths Debunked]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/5-writing-myths-debunked)) observes that there are many types of writing. While they all involve words, the processes to arrive at those words can vary greatly. Blake, however, offers no supporting evidence to these statements.

## Survival tips

Don't let the naysayers get you down. Writing is more than just putting words on a page (or screen). 

## Commentary

The work lies in coming up with the words (or the best words) to put down and not the act of putting them down.
