**Title of Project:** Technical Communications Myth Research<br/>
**Investigator Name:** Robert B. Watson<br/>
**Email Contact Information:** watson_rb@mercer.edu

You are invited to participate in an online study conducted through Mercer University. Mercer University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) requires investigators to provide informed consent to the research participants. You must indicate your decision to participate below.

The purpose of this online research is to examine technical communication myths. Your participation in the study will contribute to a better understanding of how these myths affect technical communication practice and research. You must be at least 18 years old to participate.

## If you agree to participate

The study can take as much or as little of your time as you would like to contribute. Active participation involves commenting on and about the technical communication myths found in this site. You do not need to comment to participate. You can participate simply by reading the site content and comments; however, you must agree to participate below to read the comments, even if you only want to read them. You will not be compensated for your participation.

## Risks/Benefits/Confidentiality of Data

There are no known risks or discomforts that could cause you to feel uncomfortable, distressed, sad, or tired. There will be no cost to participate. Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally, it will help us understand how technical communication practice, education, and research can be improved. Your name and email address will be kept by disqus,com (the service providing the comment functions in the site) and is independent of this study. Your comments will be publicly visible on this site to all participants. A limited number of research team members will have access to the anonymous feedback data during data collection. If you participate by commenting publicly, your comments and identity will be public, as they would in a public, online forum. If your comments are used in any published reports, they will be attributed to you. If you provide anonymous feedback, your identity will not be requested and your feedback, if used in the research, will not be attributed to you.

## Participation or Withdrawal

Your decision to participate or decline participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any question and you have the right to withdraw from participation at any time. Withdrawal will not affect your relationship with Mercer University in anyway. If, at any time, you no longer want to participate, you can simply stop commenting, delete your past comments, or inform the Principal Investigator at any time.
