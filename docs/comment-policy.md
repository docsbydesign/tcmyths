# Site purpose

I created [tcmyths.com](http://tcmyths.com) to collect myths expressed by and about Technical Communication. My goal is to learn more about these myths and so that all technical communicators can learn from them and learn about them.

While collecting these myths, I found that empirical information about them and their application was hard to find. To dispel some of the mystery, I added a comments section to each page to hear what you have to say.

# Site comments

To post comments on this site, you must have a [Disqus](https://disqus.com) account and you must be 18 years old or older.

**Comments that you post on this site are public and can be viewed by anyone, whether or not they are logged or have a Disqus account.**

## Copyright and permission

Your comments are yours. By entering your comments in this site you grant me a transferable, non-exclusive license to reproduce them here and elsewhere. If I use your comments elsewhere, I will attribute them to you. This means that you're giving me persmission, in advance, to quote your comment in a publication.

## Comment guidelines

My desire is that you will use the comments blocks to contribute your perspectives and experiences so that we can all learn from each other.

To that end, I ask that your comments:

1. **Be nice and respectful.** Disagreement is fine in the form of "I had a different experience when..." or "Jones contradicts Smith when she says..." (and include Jones' citation). But not in the form of "You're wrong..." or "You don't know what you're talking about."
1. **Be as factual as possible.**
2. **Be about your personal experience** and that you make that clear in the comment. For example, _"I have seen..."_ <br />--or--<br />**Cite a published source** if they are about someone else's experience. Your citation should be detailed enough for us to look it up. For example, _"Smith talks about this in his blog post at http://www.example.com/interesting-page."_
3. **Not be another myth.** New myths should be [suggested for consideration]({{ site.mybaseurl}}/new-myth) rather than added as a comment to a topic.
4. **Be witheld if you can't speak from a first-hand experience or cite your source.**

Comments that do not follow the guidelines will be deleted.
