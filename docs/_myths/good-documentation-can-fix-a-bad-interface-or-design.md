Documentation can be created or added at the end of a product development cycle to fix or accommodate any shortcomings of a product's design or implementation.

# Background

Unknown. Likely it was first expressed by a product manager looking for ways to minimize reworking a project to meet a delivery deadline.

# Commentary

This is to technical writing as _"We'll fix it in post"_ is to filmmaking. In practice, the flaws in a design tend to get worse over time rather than get better.


# Survival tips

As a writer, the sooner you can head off bad design decisions, the better. Participating in the design process as early as possible can help; however, in many cases, that isn't possible. If you're a writer who ends up in the unenviable position of documenting a product with a less-than-perfect design (which is just about every product), start by empathizing with your reader/customer/user and working back. Your reader will appreciate the effort (even if no one else does).
