# To contribute

Fork this repo and do your thing! This repo is set up for hosting the documentation on github.io where you can test and view your changes.

When you want to send me a new myth (or bundle of myths), send a pull request to this repo and I'll merge and test it here before pushing it to the tcmyths account for publishing on tcmyths.com.

Thanks!
