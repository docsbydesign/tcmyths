Users prefer to try and experiment with a product rather than refer to its documentation.

## Background

The [People read on the web](http://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web) article at [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com) lists several articles that describe how web-site visitors tend to not read the content verbatim. However, that doesn't say they never read the content. Instead, the references cited in [People read on the web](http://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web) describe many different types of reading styles from reading word for word to varios types of skimming and scanning methods.

Technical documentation is generally read only when it's necessary to accomplish a task and then it's only read until readers believe they know what they need to know (Redish, 2012). 

Another aspect of this myth has to do with _[long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) content whose use is difficult to predict&mdash;by definitions, it might not be read often, if ever. However, this type of content can be extremely valuable to the reader when it is accessed (or not; it's hard to predict). Refernce content is a good example of this technical documentation. Because most reference topics will not be read, it's easy (however inaccurate) to generalize "most" to "all" and conclude that no on reads technical docs.

## Survival tips

Understand the content's use-cases as seen from the user's perspective and then verify that understanding with research and analytics. Understand that research conducted on one type of web content, such as content intended to attact clicks, might not apply to technical documentation because the audiences have different motivations and contexts.
