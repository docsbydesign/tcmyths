# tcmyths
The source content used for the TC Myths website (http://tcmyths.com).
But, this is not the repo you are looking for.

Contributions are welcome! The more myths, the better.

# To contribute

Fork the tcmyths repo at https://github.com/docsbydesign/tcmyths and do your thing!
This repo is set up for hosting the documentation on github.io so you can test and view your changes.

When you want to send me a new myth (or bundle of myths), send a pull request and I'll merge and test it in the docsbydesign account before pulling it into this repo for publishing on tcmyths.com.

Thanks!
