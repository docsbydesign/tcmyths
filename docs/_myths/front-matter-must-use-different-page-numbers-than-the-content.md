Page numbers of the front-matter must be in Roman numerals.

## Background

This doesn't seem to be a myth as much as it's an excerpt from a style guide. Doyle' ([Myths about technical writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/myths-about-technical-writing)) description of this, referenced by Johnson ([14 Widespread Myths about Technical Writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/14-widespread-myths-about-technical-writing)), makes this and chapter-based page numbers sound like a convention adopted from book printing. 

## Survival tips

* Follow the style guide for the medium you're using.
