Don't mark up graphics with callouts.

## Background

Doyle ([Myths about technical writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/myths-about-technical-writing)) describes this myth and Johnson ([14 Widespread Myths about Technical Writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/14-widespread-myths-about-technical-writing)) refers to Doyle. Doyle's description makes it difficult to tell if this is a myth or a simply a tool-specific practice. Doyle describes how some word-processing tools can layer image callouts while DITA does not. The myth, however, does not qualify the practice as being tool-dependant.

## Survival tips

* Know how your authoring tool works and your reuse and localization requirements for your image assets.
* Don't make more work for yourself by having to keep mutliple versions of a single image, if you can avoid it.
